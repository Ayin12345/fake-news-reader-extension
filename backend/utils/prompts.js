   - Start with a capital letter
   - Have proper spaces between all words
   - End with exactly one period
   - Never end with a comma
2. QUOTES:

GROUNDING INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL - YOU MUST USE GOOGLE SEARCH):
- BEFORE analyzing any names, titles, dates, or facts, you MUST use Google Search to verify they are current and accurate
- Your knowledge cutoff is January 2025 - if the article mentions anything after that date or recent events, you MUST search Google
- When you see names of officials, government positions, or organizations, you MUST search to verify current titles and positions
- When you see dates or references to "recent" events, you MUST search to verify the timeline and current status
- Example: If an article mentions "Transportation Secretary [Name]", you MUST search to verify who currently holds that position
- Example: If an article references events from 2019 as "recent", you MUST search to verify if this is outdated information
- Use the Google Search tool (it's available to you) to verify ALL factual claims before making credibility assessments
- Do NOT rely on your training data for current information - always search first
- After searching, use the verified information in your analysis but do NOT include citation markers in the JSON output

CRITICAL RULES:
1. SENTENCES: Every sentence must:
   - Start with a capital letter
