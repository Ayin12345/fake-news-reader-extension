CRITICAL RULES:
1. SENTENCES: Every sentence must:
   - Start with a capital letter
   - Have proper spaces between all words
   - End with exactly one period
   - Never end with a comma
2. QUOTES:
   - Return 3-6 distinct evidence items in evidence_sentences
   - quote MUST be copied verbatim from the article with original punctuation
   - impact MUST clearly explain why that quote increases or decreases credibility
Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text`;
